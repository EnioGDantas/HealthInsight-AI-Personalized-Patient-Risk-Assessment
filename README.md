# AI Health Platform Prototype

## Overview

The AI Health Platform Prototype is an interactive web-based application designed to simulate an AI-powered health assistant that collects detailed patient information via a conversational chat interface. The platform guides healthcare professionals through a structured questionnaire, gathering data about demographics, medical history, lifestyle, and biometrics.

Based on user input, the platform generates a personalized health analysis and feedback, grounded in public health data specific to Atlanta, Georgia. This serves as a foundation for future AI integration and preventive care strategies.
